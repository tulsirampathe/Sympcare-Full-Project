# **Health Prediction System**

## **Overview**

The Health Prediction System is a powerful tool designed to predict skin diseases, overall health status, and mental health conditions based on user-provided symptoms, images, and personal information. It offers quick and reliable health assessments, aiding users in making informed decisions about their health.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Skin Disease Prediction**
2. **Disease Prediction from Symptoms**
3. **Mental Health Prediction**
4. **Role-Based Mental Health Check**
5. **Health Chatbot for Queries**

## **Features & Functionality**

### **1. Skin Disease Prediction**
- **How it Works**: Users can upload a photo of a skin ailment (e.g., rash or bump), and the system uses a trained machine learning model to detect the disease.
- **Purpose**: Helps quickly diagnose skin problems by identifying potential skin diseases based on the image.

### **2. Disease Prediction from Symptoms**
- **How it Works**: Users input their symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, cough), and the system predicts the likely disease based on three models.
- **Purpose**: Assists users in identifying diseases based on symptoms they experience.

### **3. Mental Health Prediction**
- **How it Works**: The system collects personal information (age, gender, employment status) and mental health symptoms (e.g., sadness, anxiety) to assess the risk of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or insomnia.
- **Purpose**: Detects potential mental health problems and suggests next steps.

### **4. Role-Based Mental Health Check**
- **How it Works**: Depending on the user's role (e.g., student, employee), the system asks role-specific questions (e.g., exam stress for students, work pressure for employees).
- **Purpose**: Provides tailored mental health assessments specific to the user's role.

### **5. Chatbot for Health Queries**
- **How it Works**: Users can communicate with the chatbot, asking health-related questions. The bot responds based on its training and data.
- **Purpose**: Offers quick, conversational health advice and answers general health queries.

## **How It Works Behind the Scenes**

- **Pre-trained Machine Learning Models**: The system utilizes pre-trained models, trained on a large dataset including images of skin conditions, symptom data, and mental health surveys.
- **Prediction Process**: Upon receiving user input (image or symptoms), the system processes the data with machine learning models to predict the most probable condition.
- **Personalized Experience**: The system customizes the mental health assessment questions based on the user's role (e.g., student, employee).

## **How to Use the System**

1. **Upload Images**: For skin disease prediction, simply upload a photo of the skin condition.
2. **Enter Symptoms**: For disease prediction, input your symptoms (e.g., headache, fever, etc.).
3. **Provide Personal Details**: For mental health predictions, answer questions about your personal information and mental health symptoms.
4. **Chat with the Bot**: Ask health-related questions to the chatbot, and it will provide answers based on its training.

## **Benefits**

- **Fast & Easy Health Predictions**: Get quick predictions for skin diseases and other conditions based on symptoms or images.
- **Personalized Mental Health Checks**: Receive a mental health assessment tailored to your role (e.g., student, employee).
- **Health Chatbot**: Interact with the chatbot for instant health advice and responses to general health queries.

This system helps you make educated decisions regarding your health by providing symptom-based, image-based, and personalized mental health assessments.
